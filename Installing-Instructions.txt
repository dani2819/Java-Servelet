IMPORTANT:
MINOR CHANGES IN JAVA CODE:
I write the HTML text into .txt file which i saved in my computer. So you have to go on Line:76 and 98 of WordCounter.java and change the directory according to your username.

NOTE: I also placed "demo.doc" file so that you can also show the snapshots of the working project.
